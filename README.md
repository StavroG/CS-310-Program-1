# Generic Linear List
This was a program that I completed for my data structures class in school. I used Java and eclipse to make this program. I was suppose to create my own data structure that was a LinearList. The list had to be generic so that it could accept all data types. 


What I learned:
  1. I learned how to use generics in Java. I had to use generics to make sure that my list can contain any data type.
  2. I learned how to use iteratores. I used iterators as a way or traversing through the list.
  3. I learned how to create linear list. I have used linear list before but never knew how they worked and how they were implemented.


Methods:
  1. addFirst - Adds elemetns to the begining of the list, making that element the front node. 
  2. addLast - Adds elements to the end of the list, making that element the rear node.
  3. removeFirst - Removes the first elemetn in the list. If the list has multiple elements the element that was added after the front node element becomes the front element.
  4. removeLast - Removes the last element in the list. If the list is has multiple elements the element that was in front of the last element becomes the rear element.
  5. remove - Searches the list for a value. If the value is found then that element is removed. 
  6. peekFirst - Checks what is the first element in the list. Does not affect the list.
  7. peekLast - Checks what was the last elemetn in the list. Does not affect the list.
  8. contains - Searches the list for a specfic element. If the element is in the list the list returns true, false otherwise.
  9. find - Searches the list for a specific element. Returns the element closest to the front.
  10. clear - Sets every element in the list to null.
  11. isEmpty - Checks if the list is empty.
  12. isFull - Checks if the list is full.
  13. size - Returns the size of the list.
